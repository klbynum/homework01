# Create three lists containing 10 integers each. The first list should contain all the
# integers sequentially from 1 to 10 (inclusive). The second list should contain the
# squares of each element in the first list. The third list should contain the cubes of
# each element in the first list. Print all three lists side-by-side in three columns. E.g.
# the first row should contain 1, 1, 1 and the second row should contain 2, 4, 8.
