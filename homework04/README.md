# Water Quality Turbidity Analysis

This project calculates and analyzes water turbidity based on data collected from
a Mars lab. It determines whether the water turbidity is safe for analyzing meteorite 
samples and calculates the minimum time required for turbidity to fall below a safe 
threshold.

## Python Script

The script `turbidity_analysis.py` reads the water quality data, calculates the 
current turbidity, checks if it's safe, and calculates the time required for it 
to become safe.

### How to Run the Code

1. Run the script with:

```bash
python turbidity_analysis.py
